# carbon-emmission-prediction🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to forecast carbon emissions using historical environmental, economic, and demographic data. By leveraging machine learning models, it provides insights into emission trends and helps inform sustainable policy decisions.
🔍 Problem Statement
Carbon emissions are a key driver of climate change. Accurate forecasting enables governments and organizations to anticipate future risks and implement proactive measures.
📊 Methodology
- Data Collection: Historical CO₂ emission data sourced from Kaggle and other public datasets.
- Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier treatment (Winsorization), and normalization.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Trend analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Feature Engineering: Selection via RFECV and domain knowledge.
- Modeling: Comparison of models including:
- LSTM, GRU, SimpleRNN (for time-series)
- Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation: Metrics include R², RMSE, and MSE. Time-series stationarity tested via ADF and KPSS.
